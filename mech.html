        <p class="border border-primary shadow border-top-0 cstext">The Department of Mechanical Engineering of COER is as old as the Institute itself. It is Recognized as one of the best in the state. The department offers a comprehensive and extensive course combined with the excellent infrastructural facilities. The department, besides being piloted by elite faculty, what sets it apart from the flock is the laboratories - one of the best equipped in the country. The syllabus is reviewed regularly to incorporate the cutting edge technologies prevailing in the field from time to time. <br> The Department offers a four-year course leading to the Bachelors (B.Tech) Degree in Mechanical Engineering. The Department has justifiably provided itself on the quality of its academic programmes and is keeping pace with the latest developments in engineering education. <br> The Mechanical Engineering department has been producing exceptional academic results on a consistent basis ever since its inception. Started with an intake of 60 students per year for undergraduate course, now the department admits 120 students per year including lateral entry of diploma holders to the third semester. The Department endeavours to produce confident professionals tuned to real time working environment. The Department offers excellent academic environment with a team of highly qualified faculty members to inspire the students to develop their technical skills and inculcate the spirit of team work in them. <br>The strength of the Department is highly motivated students who understand the dynamics of the industry and hone their skills accordingly. The faculty and students of the department play a leading role in various co-curricular, extra-curricular, social and community development activities. Apart from the B Tech programme, the department offers M Tech programmes in Mechanical Engineering. The primary focus of our curriculum is to impart technical know-how to students, promote their problem solving skills and also to guide and motivate them to come up with innovations in latest technological domains. <br> Department offers a large number of elective courses for providing a wide spectrum of knowledge to the students which will help students pursue their own areas of interest. The course contents are periodically updated for incorporating latest scientific and technological advances. <br> The department gives great importance to the development of research culture among students; undergraduate students are encouraged to undertake various innovative research projects to help them imbibe the research culture. The syllabus emphasizes on core mechanical domains like Production, Design and Thermal Engineering. The various labs and workshops encompass the vital aspects of Mechanical Engineering viz, Hydraulics, Machine Tools, Heat Engines etc. <br> Industrial visits and Educational tours are made an integral part of the curriculum to familiarize the students with the industrial environments, working conditions and great industrial developments. In order to indulge deeply in their particular field of interest, the pre-final and final year students electively specialize in relevant areas like Aerodynamics, Finite Element Analysis, Welding Technology, Cryogenics, Machine Tools, Project Management etc. <br> The students of the Department get placed in premier Indian and multinational core Mechanical Engineering companies and go on to attain prestigious positions. Many of our students are also pursuing Masters/Doctorate from NITs/IITs and Abroad Universities. <br> The Department is producing several eminent engineers who are making notable contributions in Mechanical Engineering projects in India as well as abroad</p><br><br>
