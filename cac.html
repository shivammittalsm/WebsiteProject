    <b class="text-dark">COER AERO CLUB (CAC)</b><br>
    COER AERO CLUB (CAC) is an aviation club of COER. It works in the field of design and aviation by making Remote Controlled (RC) planes and multirotors etc. The club was formed by student of batch 2011-15, Mr. Varun Joshi (ME Branch) with the help of Mr. Varun Pratap Singh, Assistant Professor (ME Branch) in 2015. Mr. Varun Pratap Singh Assistant Professor (ME Branch) is convener of the club and Karan Pratap Singh (EN-IV) is a student coordinator of Club. The main Object of this club is enhancing the students towards the aviation science and provides them well knowledge about RC planes, Multirotors & Gliders etc.The club members have participated in many competition and workshops like IIT Roorkee Techfest, IIT Kanpur Techfest, IIT Kharagpur Techfest and BOEING Workshop in last 3 years and Varun Joshi (ME-branch) (2011-15 batch) got 1st position in RC flying competition in IIT Roorkee Techfest in 2015.Now the Club is enhancing the students towards the aviation science and new technology of it. The major annual events of club are to conduct workshop on making Gliders and RC planes with integration of renowned clubs and institutes of this field. CAC having standardized lecture series, tutorials and formats of training for new comers, where students can groom their thoughts for aviation by making RC plans and Drons. CAC also having focused in the field of R&D activity to find out the gap for further work so our team members can make major projects for either industry or R&D institutions. CAC is also planning to run the Joint training program with other academic and research institution by collaborating with one or two renowned national clubs. The vision of club is that, in future club will work in the field of research by making major project which can use by defense and other industries, who are looking for their RC plane/ Dron solution (like RC Plane which can lift 2.5 kg weight ffor30 minutes, RC plane for topographic survey and RC plane for construction activities) and start research publication.
