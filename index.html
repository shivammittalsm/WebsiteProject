        <div class="col-sm-9 font-italic border font-weight-bold shadow text-justify gcontent">
          In May, at the visit of a delegation from India, a memorandum of understanding was signed between the Kuban State Agrarian University and the College of Engineering Roorkee (COER). As a result of this agreement, and with the full assistance of Dr. Asutosh Kaushik, we are happy to be here, in this country, in this college. Because, India is a special country, it is a separate world with its own characteristics and culture, religions, history. Thanks to the college administration, we learned a lot about the Indian education system, traditions and culture. We had a unique opportunity to visit the most beautiful places and cities such as Haridwar, Dehradun, Rishikesh, Mussoorie. Drive through the picturesque places of the Himalayan mountains, feel the flavor of Indian cuisine, unlike any other in the world, and during this time even get used to its spiciness. It is especially pleasant to note the friendly attitude of the college staff. And it is surprising that most of them are aware of Russia. And this is no accident, because over the years, Russia and India have been strategic partners on many issues and we hope that our jointly implemented area of cooperation in education is an additional brick to the strong building of cooperation between our country.
